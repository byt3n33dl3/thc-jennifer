      Advanced KeePass Password Cracker,  1.1.0
              Licensed under BSD-2.0

Jennifer du' Casse is the most Advanced KeePass .kdbx cracking software. Support cracking KDBX3 (KeePass 2.x) and KDBX4. Designed to handle all versions of KeePass database files (.kdbx), including the newer 2.36+ versions that use the KDBX4 format.

Unlike some existing tools, Jennifer can efficiently process both AES-KDF and Argon2-based key derivation methods.

Supports all KeePass versions (including >=2.36)
Works with both AES-KDF and Argon2 key derivation
Multi-threaded for maximum performance
Includes default wordlist for quick testing
Progress tracking with accurate ETA
Simple command-line interface

Jennifer Operates by directly parsing the KDBX file structure to extract cryptographic parameters such as:

Master seed
Transform seed (KDBX3)
Encryption IV
Stream start bytes
KDF parameters (including Argon2 parameters for KDBX4)

The binary implements several key technologies:

Multi-threaded password attempts for maximum performance
Direct KDBX format parsing (both v3 and v4)
Real-time progress statistics with ETA calculation
Automatic detection of KeePass database version and encryption method
Memory-efficient wordlist processing

Functions:

Parses the KDBX header to determine version and encryption parameters
Loads the wordlist into memory for efficient processing
Spawns multiple worker threads to attempt passwords in parallel
Uses cryptographic operations to verify each password against the database
Provides real-time statistics on cracking progress
Immediately reports when a password is successfully found

Usage:

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ jennifer [kdbx-file]
```

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ jennifer [kdbx-file] [wordlist]
```

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ jennifer [kdbx-file] [wordlist] -v
```

By default, Jennifer is already advanced enough for knowing a wordlist usage, without a custom worlist jennifer can only crack a possible 100 password. and the verbosity [-v] is going to be just for seeing Jennifer cracking processes.

Usage:

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ jennifer secret.kdbx rockyou.txt -v
