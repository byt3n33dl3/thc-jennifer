The most advanced password recovery 
For all version of .kdbx (KeePass 2.X) by: @byt3n33dl3
								  version: 1.1.0

```

Jennifer du' Casse is the most Advanced KeePass .kdbx cracking software. Support cracking KDBX3 (KeePass 2.x) and KDBX4. Designed to handle all versions of KeePass database files (.kdbx), including the newer 2.36+ versions that use the KDBX4 format.

Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes. (This is the wish of the author and non-binding. Many people working in these organizations do not care for laws and ethics anyways. You are not one of the "good" ones if you ignore this.)

## COMMAND:

```
jennifer [kdbx-file]
jennifer [kdbx-file] [wordlist]
jennifer [kdbx-file] [wordlist] -v
```

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ jennifer [kdbx-file]
```

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ jennifer [kdbx-file] [wordlist]
```

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ jennifer [kdbx-file] [wordlist] -v
```

By default, Jennifer is already advanced enough for knowing a wordlist usage, without a custom worlist jennifer can only crack a possible 100 password. and the verbosity [-v] is going to be just for seeing Jennifer cracking processes.
